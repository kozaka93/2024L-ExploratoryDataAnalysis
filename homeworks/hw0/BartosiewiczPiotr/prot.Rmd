This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
proton()
```
```{r}
employees[employees$surname == "Insecure",]
```


```{r}
proton
```


```{r}
proton(action = "login", login="johnins")
```


```{r}
for (i in 1:length(top1000passwords)){
  licznik = i
  x = proton(action = "login", login="johnins",password=top1000passwords[i])
  if (x =="Success! User is logged in!"){
    break
  } 
}
haslo = top1000passwords[licznik]
```

```{r}
count
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
